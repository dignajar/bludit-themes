# Lingonberry
Lingonberry is a clean and simple theme for bloggers, with responsive design and beautiful typography.
Developed by Anders Norén for Wordpress, Lingonberry is now available for Bludit. Ported by Hakim Zulkufli.

# Keep it simple, stupid
Lingonberry’s got all the features you need, and none that you don’t. It’s designed to be easy to install, use and visit.

# Beautiful design
As the name implies, Lingonberry has a charming, simple and colorful visual style that is easy on the eyes (and on the loading times).

# Responsive & retina
Responsive design and high-resolution assets means that Lingonberry will scale gracefully and look great on all devices – big and small, retina and non-retina.
